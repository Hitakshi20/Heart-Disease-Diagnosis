# Heart-Disease-Diagnosis
This project analyses the **Heart Disease** dataset (available on Kaggle) containing 14 variables (e.g., age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol) for 297 patients.  The data can be used to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their clinical measurements and demographics.
